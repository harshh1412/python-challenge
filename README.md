# python-challenge

I did a poor job submitting this assignment yesterday. I tried "git pushing" at the last moment and couldn't do it so I just uploaded the python file and the output CSV file for just the PyBank task on GitHub and submitted the link.
I'm very embarrassed, to say the least! I just wanted to communicate what happened and take responsibility.
I have already messaged my Instructional Team and my Student Success Advisor about the same on Slack.
I have also pushed all the files and folders to the repository now as advised by my Instructor.
